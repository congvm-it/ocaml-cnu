# What is the difference between a theorem, a lemma, and a corollary?

01. Definition - __A precise and unambiguous__ description of the meaning of a mathematical term. 

It characterizes the meaning of a word by __giving all the properties__ and __only those properties that must be true.__

02. Theorem - a mathematical statement that is __proved using rigorous mathematical reasoning.__

In a mathematical paper, the term theorem is often reserverd for the most important results. 

03. Lemma - a minor result whose sole purpose is to help in proving a theorem. 

It is a stepping stone on the path to proving a theorem. Very occasionally lemmas can take on a life of their own (Zorn's lemma, Urysohn's lemma, etc.) 

04. Corollary - a result in which the (usually short) proof relies heavily on a given theorem. (we often say that "This is a corollary of Theorem A")

05. Proposition - a proved and often interesting result, but generally less important than a theorem.

06. Conjecture - __a statement__ that is __unproved__, but __is believed to be true__ (Collatz conjecture, Goldbach conjecture, etc)

07. Claim - an assertion that is then proved. It is often used like an informal lemma.

08. Axiom/Postulate - a statement that is assumed to be true without proof. 

These are the basis bulding blocks from which all theorems are proved (Euclide's file postulates, Peano axioms)

09. Identity - a mathematical expression that giving the equality of two (oftenm variable) quantities (trigonometric identities, Euler's identity)

10. Paradox - a statement that can be shown using a given set of axioms and definitions, to be both true and false. Paradoxes are often used to show inconsistencies in a flawed theory (Russell's paradox). The term paradox is often used informally to describe a surprising or counterintuitive result that follows from a given set of rules
