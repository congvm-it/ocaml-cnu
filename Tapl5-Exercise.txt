Exercises


5.1 Basics


(Core calculus and dervied forms)

 - Explain briefly what is a core caclulus and what are derived forms?

 [SOLUTION]

A core caclulus is a mechanism in which all computation is reduced to the basic operations of function definition
and application.

A derived form is also a mechanism which are used to translate the computation into the core.


(The syntax of lambda calculus)

 - Write the syntax of the lambda calculus:

 [SOLUTION]

The syntax of lambda calculus: t ::= x | λx.t | t t


 - What is variable in the syntax in the syntax?

[SOLUTION]

Variables is letter standing for arbitrary terms in the syntax. t ::= x


 - What is abstraction in the syntax?

[SOLUTION]

  An abstraction in the syntax is a internal representation of a program as labeled trees. 
  The abstraction is represented as λx.t

 - What is application in the syntax?
 
 [SOLUTION]

  Application in the syntax is t t


 - If you write 1 + 2 + 3, it means (1 + 2) + 3.
   You don't have to write the parenthesis.

   The plus operation (+) is said to be left-associative
   because the parentheses may be omitted. 

   For 's t u', it is the same as '(s t) u'.
   If you want to write s (t u), you should not
   omit the parenthesis.

   So, the lambda application (operation) is

    (1) left associative
    (2) right associative

   ?
 [SOLUTION]
   
   #TODO


 - Explain briefly the difference between meta variables
   and (object) variables in the lambda calculus.

 [SOLUTION]

  The metavariable t stands for an arbitrary term and a variable x stands for and arbitrary variable.
  So x is a metavariable ranging over variables.


(The semantics of lambda calculus)


 - Explain briefly the difference between free variables
   and bound variables

 [SOLUTION]

  Given term t ::=  λx. t

  An occurrencce of the variable x is said to be bound when it occurs in the body t.
  An occurrencce of the variable x is said to be free if it appears in a position where it is not bound
  by an enclosing abstraction on x.


 - Explain briefly a single step evaluation ---> on
   lambda terms. 

 [SOLUTION]
    (λx. x) y 
  ⟶ [x ↦ y] x

  [x ↦ y] x means the term obtained by replacing all free occurences of x in x by y.

 - Refer to Page 22 for the definition of FV(t), a set of
   free variables occurring in the term t. 

  Explain briefly the defition of FV(t) for variable, abstraction, and
  application terms. .

 [SOLUTION]

The set of free variables of a term t is written as FV(t) which is defined as follows:

  FV(x) = {x}
  FV(λx.t1) = FV(t1) \ {x}
  FV(t1 t2) = FV(t1) ∪ FV(t2)


 - Refer to Page 23 for the definition of substitutions
   [x |->s ] t.

  Explain briefly what is [x |-> s]t. 

 [SOLUTION]

  [x ↦ s] t means the term obtained by replacing all free occurences of s by y.



5.2 Programming in the lambda calculus

 - Explain how a lambda calculus handles more than two arguments by
   writing an add function under the assumption that (+) and the
   reduction n + m are available.

   [Hint: Slide P.11]

 [SOLUTION]
  
  add = λx λy. x+y

    add 1 2
  = (add 1) 2
  = ((λx λy. x+y) 1) 2
  ⟶ [x ↦ 1] ((λy. x+y) 1) 2
  = (λy. 1+y) 2
  ⟶ [y ↦ 2] (1+y) 2
  = 1+2
  = 3


 - Explain how to encode boolean values(true and false) and a test function
   with a property as
   
      (1) test tru m n -> ... -> m
      (2) test fls m n -> ... -> n

   for some terms m and n. 

   [Hint: Slide P.12]
   
 [SOLUTION]

   tru = λt. λf. t


   fls = λt. λf. f


   test = λl. λm. λn. l m n with the property that 
    (1) (test b v w) reduces to v when b is tru
    (2) it reduces to w when b is false


 - Verify the propery using your solution.

 [SOLUTION]
 
     (1) test tru m n -> [ fill in the reduction process here ] -> m
        
      test tru m n 
    = (λl. λm. λn. l m n) tru m n
    ⟶ [l ↦ tru] (λm. λn. l m n) m n
    = (λm. λn. tru m n) m n
    ⟶ [m ↦ m] (λn. l m n) n
    = (λn. tru m n) n
    ⟶ [n ↦ n] (tru m n)
    = tru m n 
    ⟶ tru m n
    = (λt. λf. t) m n
    ⟶ [t ↦ m] (λf. t) n
    = (λf. m) n
    ⟶ [f ↦ n] (m)
    = m


     (2) test fls m n -> [ fill in the reduction process here ] -> n
     
      test fls m n 
    = (λl. λm. λn. l m n) fls m n
    ⟶ [l ↦ fls] (λm. λn. l m n) m n
    = (λm. λn. fls m n) m n
    ⟶ [m ↦ m] (λn. fls m n) n
    = (λn. fls m n) n
    ⟶ [n ↦ n] (fls m n)
    = fls m n
    = (λt. λf. f) m n
    ⟶ [t ↦ m] (λf. f) n
    = (λf. f) n
    ⟶ [f ↦ n] (f)
    = n


 - The logical conjunction (and) is defined as

        and = λb. λ c. b c fls

   Verify the defintion of and if it does the logical conjunction by showing:

   know that they works well?

 - Define the functions pair (to create a pair), fst (to select the
   first element of a pair), and snd (to select the second element of
   a pair)

 [SOLUTION]
 
    pair =


    fst =


    snd =

   terms.
